    // typically, compilers accept input in some high level language (like C) and produce output in low level (like assembly)
    // we can compile c files and create .s assembly files by running
    // gcc -S main.c
    // this produces an executable main.s, and you can do cat main.s to see its contents

    // 3 phases of compilation:
    // 1) front end: translates source code to largely-language independent intermediate representation
        // eg; gcc translates all of its input languages into 2 languages: Gimple and generic.
        // can be thought of as "abstract syntax trees"

    // 3) back end: translates intermediate language into assembly language of the machine
    // 2) middle end: semantic analysis, the compiler optimizes the code

    // note the above toolchain is idealized. in reality, the phases may be very overlapped for many compilers
    // for instance, optimizations also occur in the front end and backend of the compiler

    // COMPILER:
    // (source code) -> intermediate code -> assembly code

    // (assembly code) -> object code

    // (main.o) -> main.out


    // SUMMARY:
    // we make source code (main.c)

    // compiler (like gcc) takes source code and turns it into intermediate code then into assembly code (main.s) 

    // assembler takes that assembly code and turns it into object code (main.o)

    // linker takes the all the object code stuff and combines it into an executable (main.out)

    // main.c -> compiler [intermediate -> main.s] -> assembler [main.o] -> linker [main.out]

    // EXECUTABLE FILES
    // contains:
    // - all of instructions
    // - data section: containing items like constant strings
    // - links to dynamic libraries: contain object code that implements functions like printf

    // executables are not portable. cant copy from machine to another and assume it will run.
    // everything excluding source code, ie from assembly code to executable code is produced for specific machine hardware
    // executable not only cares about type of machine but also OS and system configurations 

    // A BIT MORE
    // after executable is made, it needs to be loaded into memory when it is executed. 
    // this is the LOADER's job

        // - sorting.c
        // - sorting.h

    // we will create a Makefile to build the parts of the project that need it
    // a Makefile is a just literally a file named Makefile (no extension, capital M is important)

    // makefile consist of a sequence of rules.
    // each rule has:
        // - target (the excecutable file to be constructed)
        // - recipe (the list of shell commands to create the target, also known as an action)
        // - dependencies (the stuff the target is dependent on)

    // FORMAT
    // target: dependencies
        // recipe

    // if the dependencies..
        // A) are newer than the target (ie have been modified after the last modification of the target)
            // then the recipes are executed

        // B) dont exist
            // then the recipes are executed if target also doesnt exist yet
    
    // example:
    // notes_sort: notes.o sorting.o
        // gcc notes.o sorting.o -o notes_sort

    // our target is notes_sort, here. so we will create a notes_sort whenever the Makefile is ran if notes.o or sorting.o have been modified.
    // view the Makefile in this repo for examples. 
    // to run the Makefile, simply type `make` in the terminal while the Makefile is in your pwd

    // to run a specific target within the Makefile, for example:
        // clean:
            // rm *.o notes_sort
    // we can just type `make clean` in the terminal
    // for targets like this that arent actual files, preceed the line with .PHONY: `clean`
            // .PHONY: clean
            // clean:
            // rm *.o notes_sort

    // REMARK:
    // when u type `make` and run a Makefile, it only evaluates the first rule in the file.
    // it does not automatically start going from top to down on each rule to evaluate it.
    // what does happen is this:
        // 1.) the first rule is evaluated
        // 2.) all the dependencies are checked
        // 3.) if the dependencies for the first rule are also targets in the makefile, it will jump and evaluate those rules first
        // 4.) this way, the rules in the makefile are recursively evaluated
    // hence it is important to select your first rule wisely if you want to just call `make`
    // otherwise you can call a specific rule to evaluate by specifying the target: `make clean`
    // here is an example of a smartly structured Makefile. all of the rules are recursively evaluated here.
        // notes_sort: notes.o sorting.o
        //     gcc notes.o sorting.o -o notes_sort

        // notes.o: notes.c sorting.h
        //     gcc -c notes.c

        // sorting.o: sorting.c sorting.h
        //     gcc -c sorting.c

        // .PHONY: clean
        // clean:
        //     rm *.o notes_sort

    // WILDCARDS
    // quick syntax for multiple files and stuff. here is an example:
    // %.o: %.c sorts.h
        // gcc -c $< -o $@

    // lets analyze this part by part:
        // %.o: %.c sorts.h
        // here the target is %.o and the dependencies are %.c (a source file of the same name) and sorts.h. % is like * for regex, it matches any nonempty string % that's followed by .c

        // gcc -c $< -o $@
        // here we create an object file from $< which symbolizes the name of the first dependency, ie; %.c
        // and $@ just means the target's name, so we give it the name of the target %.o

    // another thing is that makefile can include variables.
    // this can help a lot against having to rewrite a whole chain of files over and over again
    // at the top we define variables like:
        // OBJFILES = notes.o sorting.o
    // and we can reference the variable by doing $(OBJFILES) instead of having to write notes.o sorting.o each time.
    // the primary benefit of this is that we wont have to go and change several lines of code if we decide to add another file later into the mix.
    // its all factored out into the OBJFILES variable, the only thing we will have to change. basic coding principle.

    // LIST OF WILDCARDS
    // here is a list of useful wildcards:
    // $< : first dependency of the rule
    // $@ : target of the rule
    // $? : all dependencies that are newer than the target
    // $^ : all dependencies of current rule with duplicates removed
    // $* : the "stem" of a string matched by %. for example if main.c is matched by %.c, then the stem $* is just main

    // less usefull ones:
    // $(@D) : directory of the target file if given
    // $+ : same as $^ but preserves duplicates

    // whats weirder is that s1 isnt required to be a string when strcpy is called
    // however s2 is required to be a string: string literal or char array with null terminator

    char s1[40]; // note s1 is not a string because there is no null terminaton character
    char s2[14] = "University of";
    strcpy(s1, s2); // doesnt mutate stuff in s2

    // this is why its unsafe, we cant rlly know or detect bugs on different machines

    // there are often safe counterparts to unsafe functions like these in the C standard library
    // safe versions often add an 'n' somewhere in the name of the unsafe ones
    // the n in the name indicates there is a new n parameter in the function which will indicate
    // how much activity the function is allowed to do before it stops.

    // strncpy() is the safe counterpart to strcpy(). here is prototype:
    // char* strncpy(char* s1, const char* s2, int n)
    // same as strcpy(), but has n.
    // n indicates the max number of characters s1 can hold, and thus indicates the max number of characters to copy over INCLUDING NULL CHARACTER
    char x1[5];
    char x2[32] = "BARSSSSSSSSSS";
    strncpy(x1, x2, sizeof(x1));
    // this is also unsafe!! not guaranteed to add a null terminator unless we find one in the first n characters of x2!
    printf("%s\n", x1); // only enough characters to fill x1 are copied, but not a null terminator
    // will print some random stuff after first n characters of x2

    // so what we must do is explicitly add a null string after strncpy is called
    x1[4] = '\0';
    printf("%s\n", x1); // this works! prints BARS

    // CONCATENATING STRINGS
    char ss1[10] = "Mon";
    char ss2[10] = "day";
    // want to add them together
    // s3 = s1 + s2 wont work because it just sums the addresses together
    // we can use the function strcat()
    // char* strcat(char* s1, const char* s2)

    // strcat adds the characters from s2 to the end of string s1
    // both s1 and s2 must be strings prior to calling strcat.

    // just like strcpy(), strcat() is an unsafe function. 
    // q1 couldve had too little space for having everything from q3 appended to it
    
    // use strncat
    // char* strncat(char* s1, const char* s2, int n)
    // n indicates the max number of characters that should be copied over from s2
    // this value of n is excluding null terminator

    // important!! unlike strncpy, strncat always adds a null terminator to the end of s1 automatically!

    // safe way:
    strncpy(q1, q2, sizeof(q1));
    strncat(q1, q3, sizeof(q1) - strlen(q1) - 1);
    // we see that sizeof(q1) - strlen(q1) = space left in q1 for more characters,
    // then we also subtract 1 to ensure space for a null terminator. 


    // SEARCHING THROUGH STRINGS
    // std C library has several functions for this
    // one is: strchr, which searches for a single character inside a string
    // char* strchr(const char* s, int c)
    // s is the string to search, and c is the character to search for in the string provided as an ASCII code
    // strchr searches from left to right in the string.

    // strchr returns a pointer to the character that was found or NULL if it was not found.
    // so strchr doesnt return the index of the character in the string but rather returns the address to where that character is.

    char r1[30] = "University of C Programming";
    char* p;
    p = strchr(r1, 'v'); // p points to the address of v within r1
    // hence you could say p is a substring of r1
    printf("%s\n", p); // will print "versity of C Programming"
    // since p is the offset address of v in r1, we can use arithmetic to find the offset from s1 to p which represents the index.
    // offset = p - r1
    printf("index of the character v in r1 is %d\n", p-r1);
    // this works because each char is a byte

    // for searching for an entire substring within a string we use strstr()
    // char* s strstr(const char* s1, const char* s2)
    // strstr searches left to right in s1 for the first occurence of the substring s2
    // just like strchr, strstr returns a pointer to the first character which begins the match to the substring s2

    // if we wanted more bits, then we can just use an unsigned int instead, giving us 32.

    // note the array isn't of N bits, it's of N unsigned ints, giving us 32*N bits to work with.

    int bit = 34;

    // we can use integer division to find the index in bit_array2 that contains the integer with the 34th bit.
    // naturally we know the first one is gonna contain 32 bits (bits 0 to 31), so the second one will contain the 34th bit.

    int bit_place = bit % 32; // gives us 2, so bit-2 of the second integer holds the 34'th bit (remember the 0'th bit is the gonna be the "actual first" bit of the integer)

        // eg) fprintf, fscanf, fgets, fputs, fread, fwrite, etc.

    // unbuffered IO:
        // data is sent to the file or read from the file immediately. no buffering. read or write one byte at a time.
        // eg) read, write, open, close, lseek, etc.
 
    // so far we've only been using IO operations that operate on streams, using file objects
    // fopen, fclose, fgets, fscanf, fprintf, .. etc.
    // these are all buffered IO operations.

    // these functions are great to use on files because they hide the complexity of some of the IO system calls
    // we now investigate unbuffered IO calls, ie) we learn about the actual system calls and how they work.

    // we say that buffered IO calls buffer data. ie) the system calls may read or write larger chunks of data than the user has specified.
    // so our unbuffered IO operations collect data in larger chunks.

    // collecting data in larger chunks helps amortize the cost of data transfer by reducing the number of system calls we might need to make.
    // analogy: instead of sailing on a rowboat to trade a few cargos back and forth between islands, just load several cargos on a frigate.

    // now we start investigating how to actually utilize multiple processes! very cool stuff.

    // since we can use fork() to make multiple processes, which can then work on the task simultaneously, then we will be able to solve problems faster.
    // remark: if we have a single processor only, then having more processes does nothing. however, multiple processors = simultaneous execution of different processes.

    // but now we realize, for these processes to work together, they need communication.
    // pipes are one form of this communication. 

    // PIPES
        // used to relay information between two related processes
        // a pipe is specified by an array of 2 file descriptors: {x, y}. one for reading data from the pipe, and one for writing data to the pipe.
        // pipe(int arr[2]) is a system call to create a pipe.

    // we can create a pipe by calling the pipe() system call as follows:

    int arr[2];
    pipe(arr);
    // this creates a read file descriptor in arr[0] and a write file descriptor in arr[1].
    // useless to have this for a lone process, the magic happens when we use fork().

    // when calling fork(), the child process inherits the same pipe. ie) it gets a copy of the pipe that can be thought of as a deep copy between the two processes, like this:
    // parent <--> pipe <--> child

    // however, note that pipes are UNI-DIRECTIONAL, ie) one way. so we can choose to either:
        // 1.) parent writes, child reads
        // 2.) child writes, parent reads
    
    // for example we could have 2.)
    // child --(write)--> pipe --(read)--> parent
    // having arrows denoting the flow of data, we simply get:
    // child --> pipe --> parent

    // we must close the unused file descriptors once we decide the flow of data.
    // for example if the parent is only reading, then we would close the parent's write file descriptor
    // if the child is only writing then we close the child's read file descriptor

    // once the pipe is set up, we can use read and write system calls to send and receive data on the pipe.
    // here is an example where the parent writes and child reads

    // IMPORTANT REMARK: the pipe() call must be made before the fork() call because the child process inherits the open file descriptors from the parent.

int dup2_redirection() {
    // in this section we learn how to redirect input/output from one file descriptor to another with dup2_redirection() system call

    // motivation:
    // we take a look at the shell's redirection operators.
    // many useful shell programs read their input from stdin and write to stdout
    // for example:
        // grep Saitama io-stuff -r
        // searches for lines containing "Saitama" in recursively in io-stuff. outputs this:
        // io-stuff/io_stuff.txt:Saitama 999999

    // this would only print to shell but we can redirect output to save it to a file with redirection operator:
        // grep Saitama io-stuff -r > temp.txt

    // we can even use output of one program is the input for another program with pipe |
        // grep Saitama io-stuff -r | wc
        // this gives:       1       2      36
    
    // so | has the following form
    // <producer> | <consumer>
    // where <producer> is what produces the input which goes into <consumer> which may produce an output 

    // now supposed we just want to change stdout for the shell process so it writes to a file by default instead of the screen
    // we use dup2_redirection to do this.

    // DUP2_redirection()
    // dup2_redirection makes a copy of an open file descriptor. 
    // we will use it to reset the stdout file descriptor, so writes to stdout go to a file instead of screen.

    // a file descriptor is really an index into a table, the "fd table", which is part of the PCB.

    // recall each process has its own PCB. hence, each process has its own unique fd table.
    // table contains pointers to data structures that contain information about open files.
    // eg) the 0 index in fd tables usually contain a link to the console (stdin coming from terminal).

    // when a child process is created (using fork), it obtains a copy of the fd table from its parent
    // even though the file descriptor tables are separate, the pointers in them may point to the same object!
    // changes to the object (eg a console) will be observed by both processes.

    // the way to use dup2_redirection is as follows:

    // 1.) open file to set stdin to read from or stdout to write to (in our case we are gonna change stdout)
    FILE* stream;
    if ((stream = fopen("io-stuff/write_here.txt", "w")) == NULL) { // rmk, its important to add the extra () around: stream = fopen("io-stuff/write_here.txt", "w" or else error.
        perror("file open");
        exit(1);
    }

    // fileno() is a function that extracts the file number of a file pointer. for example stdout is typically 1:
    printf("%d\n", fileno(stdout));

    // any opened files will usually have a file number 3, 4, 5.. so on depending on the order they were opened. 
    // recall that 0, 1, and 2 are taken by stdin, stdout, and stderr, so we begin assigning new file numbers to new streams starting from 3. 
    printf("%d\n", fileno(stream)); // as expected, we get three.

        exit(1);
    }

    // dup2_redirection(fileno(stream), fileno(stdout)); is the call we made in case it is hard to see it surrounding the error check.

    printf("whats up!\n"); // prints to stdout which is now write_here.txt

    // it is good practice to close any file descriptors we are not going to be using.
    // we should close stream because we are not going to be writing to the file directly with something like fprintf, but we write to it as stdout.

    // lets play around on sort and uniq programs.
    // sort can take a filepath as an argument and print all the lines in the file in a sorted manner.
    // eg)

    // we are going to need some background information on the internet:
    // each machine has an internet protocol: aka an IP address.
    // this is an address that can be used to send a message to it from any other machine thats connected to the internet.

    // there may be lots of different programs that need to communicate over the internet, but we only have one IP address for each machine.
    // messages sent across the internet are destined for a particular program; we need PORTS to specify this. 

    // PORTS
    // if a machine's IP address is like street address, then a PORT is like an apartment number in the building at that address
    // so the full location of a program running on a machine connected to the internet is its machine address plus the port
    // 195.67.7.8: 22

    // think of these as packages; contain both the address and a payload-the contents of the package.
    // however the packet does not specify the route it travels to get to the destination. the route is determined as the packet moves (dynamically).

    // when packet leaves machine, it is received by another device called a router. a router facilitates the transfer of packets between networks.
    // routers are connected to multiple networks and know which network the packet should be sent to in order to get it closer to its final destination.

    // Client and Server:
    // SERVER: 
    // a server is a program running on a specific port of a certain machine waiting for another program or many other programs to relay data.
    // many common services have defined ports. eg) web pages are typically served on port 80.
    // secure webpages use port 443

    // in other cases, the person running the server publishes the machine address and port, basically saying: to run my game join at this address <machine address>:<port>
    // like hosting a minecraft server with port forwarding.

    // CLIENT:
    // users run a client program when they want to start interacting with a server.
    // the client program sends the initial message. in some cases the client sends only a single message. in other cases, the client begins a connection.
    // a connection is a conversation between the two machines that involves multiple messages.
    // once the programs have established a communications channel, then either machines can send data to each other.

    // now the question boils down to, "how can we establish a communications channel" ?
    // to do this we can use SOCKETS!!

    // there are many different kinds of sockets, but the different types all rely on the same system calls. here are some examples:
        // datagram sockets
        // stream sockets
        // raw sockets
        // domain sockets
        
    // as a result, these system calls have many different and sometimes confusing options to allow you to set up the kind of socket that you want.

    // we will just focus on one kind: stream sockets.
    // stream sockets are built on the TCP protocol. TCP sockets:
        // are connection oriented sockets
        // guarantee there will be no message loss in transit
        // messages will be delivered in the order they are sent.

    // the first system call we need is socket()
    // int socket(int domain, int type, int protocl)

    // this system call is used to create an "endpoint" for communication. 
    // after having everything set up, we will need one end point in the client program and one end point in the server.
    // so both programs must independently invoke this system call.

    // the return value of socket() is an int which is -1 if we get an error. 
    // if the call is successful, the return value is an index to an entry in the file descriptor table 

    // the domain parameter sets the "protocol family", ie the general set of rules used for communications. we will typically set this to the defined constant PF_INET or AF_INET. 
    // actually AF_INET and PF_INET are defined to be the exact same value. we have 2 definitions of same thing for historical reasons.
    
    // the second parameter type which specifies the type of socket. as we are working with stream sockets, we will use SOCK_STREAM.

    // the third parameter protocol configures which protocol specifically the socket will use for communication.
    // recall that stream sockets use the TCP protocol. actually TCP is the only protocol available for stream sockets, so we just provide 0 in the protpcol parameter.
    // providing 0 tells the socket system call to use the default protocol for this type of socket.

    // both our client and server programs will call socket() like this and create a socket end point. 
    // the file descriptor returned by the socket call will be the system calls that establish a connection. (this is explain in next section)

    // eg) little endian vs big endian machines will have different bit orders.
    // we want to ensure the 2 machines that are communicating are speaking the same language.
    // so we add a middle language as a "protocol" so both machines know what to expect over the network.
    // so we use htons to put the port numbers in the protocol format.

    // more specifically, htons converts "the byte order of host machine to NETWORK BYTE ORDER".
    // suppose the machine already uses network byte order, then htons does nothing.

    // TERMINOLOGY SIDE NOTE: recall structs have "members". these can also be called fields. the terms are interchanged depending on the context but yeah.

    // 3.) -- SIN_ADDR --
    // now the third member, in_addr, is a struct itself. in_addr specifies the machine address of the socket.
    // the only field of sin_addr is s_addr.
    addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY; // we just set it to this constant.
    // this configures the socket to accept connections from any of the addresses of the machine..
    // but wait , dont machines have a single address? not always actually. a machine can have multiple network interface cards and can be plugged into several networks.
    // this way a machine could have several IP addresses, each on a different network.
    // so "a machine has a different address per network"

    // rmk: a machine also has an address for itself. this is localhost: 127.0.0.1
    // so a computer X may have an IP address like 123.456.78.910
    // then to join a server on X from some computer we could connect to it using that address.
    // however if we run the client program on the same machine (on X), we could connect to the server just using localhost 127.0.0.1

    // 4.) -- SIN_ZERO --
    // now the last field, sin_zero, is just used for extra padding.
    // this is just used to make the sockaddr_in struct the same length as the generic sockaddr struct. pretty simple, we just add 8 bits.
    // recall that when we malloc sockaddr_in, the stuff that was in the memory space previously wont automatically be reset unless we set it to something.
    // we already set all the other 3 members, so they wont contain any old data. so we also want to set the padding to something, we just do memset and set everything to 0.
    // the reason we want our old data to be wiped is bc it could contain vulnerable information that malicious third parties could intercept and use to do bad things 
    memset(&addr.sin_zero, 0, 8);

    // now we have set up our stuct sockaddr_in and we are ready to pass it as an argument to bind().
    // but wait, isn't bind expecting a pointer to sockaddr struct not sockaddr_in?
    // we just cast it lol. so call like this: bind(X, (struct sockaddr*) &addr, Y)

    // 3rd and last parameter to bind is just the length of the address we are passing. can easily get this by using sizeof() on struct sockaddr_in.
    // now we are finally ready to call bind:

    // the return value of bind is used for error checking:
    if (bind(listen_soc, (struct sockaddr*) &addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr)) == -1) {
        perror("bind");
        close(listen_soc);
        exit(1);
    }
    // confirming the success of bind is particularly important. suppose the port we picked is not available because its already in use. then bind would fail in this case.
    
    // so now we have bound a socket to a particular port on a particular machine. next we need to tell the machine to start looking for connections.
    // the system call to start looking for connections is listen()
    // int listen(int socket, int backlog)
    
    // the return value of listen is for error checking 
    // the first parameter socket is the same socket we r setting up. 
    // the second parameter backlog is a little more complicated. backlog denotes the maximum number of "partial connections" the server can hold.

    // PARTIAL CONNECTIONS:
    // basically a pending request to connect to the server. the requests are not immediately connected, they most go through some "work" of being accepted.
    // backlog denotes the maximum number of this queue.

    // for our purposes, we shall just set backlog to 5. then we call listen like so:
    if (listen(listen_soc, 5) < 0) {
        perror("listen");
        exit(1);
    }

    // now the last system call that our server needs to establish a connection with the client is accept()
        // int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr* address, socklen_t* addrlen)
    // first param: sockfd is just the listening socket we've been setting up.
    // second param: address. accept uses address to communicate back to the caller; the address of the client.
    // so when accept returns, the second parameter will point the a struct that holds the client's address information.

    // note that accept() is a blocking system call, just like read(). it will wait until a connection is established.
    // so for example, if u call accept and no client attempts to connect then accept will not return immediately; it will block.
    // accept can return if there was an error tho. return value is -1 if accept() fails.
    // however, on success, the value of accept() isnt 0, it's a positive integer representing a new socket which we will use to communicate with the client. we will explore this soon.
 
    // so basically since the return value is being used to return a new socket index, it cant be used to return the address of a client.
    // thats why we have the struct addr* pointer.
    // also just as before, we will actually pass in struct sockaddr_in* and cast it as (struct sockaddr*)

    struct sockaddr_in client_addr;
    // only thing we need to configure for this struct will be the sin_family
    client_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;

    // similarly, the third parameter will be set to the length of the address. we already know what the size is going to be since it's a sock stream with domain AF_INET and TCP protocol.
    // so we calculate that as below: 
    __u_int client_len = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in);
    // and pass in the pointer of client_len into the accept() call.

    // now we make the call:
    int client_socket = accept(listen_soc, (struct sockaddr*) &client_addr, &client_len);
    // when we make this call, the program blocks and waits for a connection to be made from client side. we will now write a program, client.c, that sends a connection.
    // remember, the return value of accept will be the file descriptor for client socket stream, and -1 if it fails.
    if (client_socket == -1) {
        perror("accept");
        exit(1);
    }


    /* from here on, start reading client.c as well */
    // we must make a connect() system call from client program. this will be client.c
        // int connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr* address, soclen_t addrlen)

    // first parameter is going to be a socket created on the client side.
    // second parameter is going to be the address of the socket on the server to which we want to connect. we have to know this address!

    // we gotta know the port number, but we also need to know the machine address: ie) the IP address of the machine.
    // humans know the machine "names" typically, but probably not the IP address. so we can get the IP address by providing a sys call with the machine's name.
    // this is assuming we somehow know the machine's name.
    // the sys call we use for this is getaddrinfo()
        // int getaddrinfo(char* host, char* service, struct addrinfo* hints, struct addrinfo** result)
    // this looks at the internet address of a machine based on its name. this is a powerful system call. 

    // we just show the simplest possible use case of getaddrinfo() here. we completely ignore the second and third parameters of getaddrinfo, and just set them as NULL.
    // the first parameter, host, is a string which is the name of the host machine. the last parameter is a pointer to a pointer of a linked list of structs.
    // there could potentially be more than one address that satisfies our request for address information (not sure how). 
    // each element in the linked list is information about one of those valid addresses.

    // the getaddrinfo() sys call expects us to create a pointer and pass its address. then it allocates memory for linked list of address info and sets the pointer to point to the list.
    // struct addrinfo* result; // so we pass this address as last param into getaddrinfo()

    // btw all of this code is gonna be on client.c so yea
    // so the system call getaddrinfo() allocates memory for the linked list in result on the heap. 
    // we also get a function we call to free that memory when we are finished.
    // this function is freeaddrinfo(struct addrinfo* result); just pass in result when we are done.

    // but before we free the result, we want to use the information obtained in it to set the server address and connect.
    // we will look at only the first address information struct from the linked list. this is the one pointed at directly by result.
    // after called getaddrinfo, we can obtain this by just doing
    // server.sin_addr = ( (struct sockaddr_in *) result->ai_addr )->sin_addr;

    // lets break it down: (starts dancing* jk)
    // result->ai_addr returns a sockaddr generic address. we cast that to sockaddr_in* then extract sin_addr from that.
    // recall sockaddr_in has a sin_addr address. we then assign that to the server sockaddr_in that we are making for connect().
    // like shown above: server.sin_addr = ( (struct sockaddr_in *) result->ai_addr )->sin_addr;

    // now we have successfully set up our server sockaddr_in, and we can call connect.
    // note that connect returns -1 if we fail. btw make sure u are reading client.c to understand all of this, or else it will sound like raw yaps.


    // IMPORTANT REMARK ABOUT CONNECTING TO HOSTS:
    // the getaddrinfo() is useful because we can just pass in something like a URL for a website that's hosted on a domain and retrieve its IP address.
    // however, for connecting to a local machine, we note that there is no notion of a "host name".
    // the idea of a host name for a local machine only extends to the local network. 
    // for example my computer's name may be Faisal's Computer, and this information would be useful only on my local network.
    // however if someone who was far away wanted to connect to a server hosted locally on my machine, they would need my actual IP address.
    // because, consider that "Faisal's Computer" is not a unique name. it's not a server hosted somewhere on the web.
    // in other words you would need the name of the server's router given that it has a public domain on the internet.
    // disclaimer: not entirely sure about all of this, it is just what i think from researching on the net.

int issue_with_blocking_read() {
    // we introduce a problem with using a blocking read() calls to read from multiple sources.
    // then we introduce a new system call that solves this problem by telling us which sources are ready for processing.

    // consider a simple scenario with a parent who has 1 child and a pipe set up between them.
    // the parent wants to read from chill so we call read() which will block until we get some write() from the parent or the parent closes the write end of the pipe().
    // simple enough.

    // now consider a parent with two children, child1 and child2. suppose the parent has two pipes set up, pipe1, and pipe2, and is reading from both children.
    // so we need 2 different calls to read(), one for each pipe. 
    // in fact we probably want to have multiple read calls to each child since they usually will have more information.

    // suppose we read them in the order: read child 1 pipe, then read child 2 pipe. and we read them like this in a loop.
    // this works fine if child 1 writes. but what if child 1 doesnt write at all but child 2 writes a bunch.
    // we wont be able to get to child 2 pipe read call because the read call for child 1's pipe will be blocking the program.
    // this is rlly bad because we are keeping one child's writes waiting, and they can accumulate a lot to the point the pipe even gets full.    

    // similarly even if we read for child 2 first, after we read once we get to the read call for child 1 and our program just blocks as child 1 has nothing to say.
    // so essentially we are required for both of them to read and write sequentially in order, which is a big restraint. so order reading calls cant fix this.

    // the resolution to this is the select() system call which lets us specify a set of file descriptors to read from, and then blocks until at least one of them is ready.
    // then select() tells us which file descriptors are ready so we can call read() only on those and avoid blocking on the non ready ones.

    // in either case, we can then be certain that the file descriptors that select() specifies will be "ready", ie) it wont cause ready to block.

    // the way this happens is that select() modifies the read_fds set we pass in to contain only fd's that are ready. 
    // can have more than one fd ready when select() returns.
