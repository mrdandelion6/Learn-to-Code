# Learn JavaScript!

Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository! 🚀 This repository is a collection of my notes and code snippets as I embark on the journey of learning JavaScript.

## Contents
- `notes.js`: Dive into my detailed notes on various JavaScript concepts.
- `index.js`, `index.html`, and `style.css`: These files were created for testing purposes during my learning process and may not be particularly useful.
- `compare.java`: This was created for comparing Java code syntax and behaviour against JavaScript during my learning process and may also not be particularly useful. 

## Interactive Site
Explore a simple interactive site I built using basic JavaScript! Check it out [here](https://mrdandelion6.github.io/Learn-JavaScript/). The code for this project can be found in the `increase-decrease` branch of this repository.

Feel free to clone the repository and experiment with the code. You could also follow along by using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) in terminal, for quick and lightweight experimentation (I did this a lot)! If you have any suggestions or find areas for improvement, don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request.

Happy coding.
